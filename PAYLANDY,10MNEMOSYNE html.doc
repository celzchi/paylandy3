<h1>STEM</h1>
<h2> Ashley Mae L. Paylandy </h2>
<p1>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) will nurture students’ ability to gauge from simple to complex problems of the society and how these learners are responsive and active in designing its solutions through researches as to apply and integrate scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematical ideas. STEM strands will also prepare learners for college degrees that focus on the perplexity of the intrinsic world making them the future scientists, experts in technological advancement, engineers, mathematicians and so on.</p1>
<p2>STEM subjects enhance cognitive abilities, such as thinking, reading, and learning, by challenging students to engage in analytical thinking, coding, and engineering principles from an early age, promoting problem-solving proficiency.
After i graduate, the strand i will choose is STEM because since i was young i loved to draw and i wanted to be an architect in the future so i can build a house for my mother in return for her sacrifices and suffering for us besides that i also want to help with all expenses so my mother doesn't have to work since she have asthma and when i become a successful architect i want to build a village where homeless beggars will live and give them opportunity to work and have a peaceful life. Besides that, my cousin and i also have a plan to build a restaurant that i will design.</p2>
